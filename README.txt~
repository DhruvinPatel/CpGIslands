Input and Output Files Format:

Sequence Files: "training.txt" is the input genomic sequence. The whole sequence
is divided in multiple lines and such format is known as multi-fasta.  Note that
the length of the complete sequence for the given training file should be 85000.
A similar test file (testing.txt) is given to you.

FILE cpg_island_training.txt format: A separate file denoting the cpg islands in the training sequence where:
1. Each line of this file denotes a cpg island in the above sequence.  
2. Consider the following.  347 584. It denotes that the cpg island starts
from position 347 and ends at position 584 (584 included).  

TASK: To generate a similar cpg_island file for the test data using your learned model.

Program is as follows:

1. Given a training data file and the corresponding file denoting cpg islands in the sequence, learns the HMM model.

HOW TO RUN:
python
